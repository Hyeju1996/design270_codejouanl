# March 10,2022.

- We are talking about SVG today, SVG is about logo code. When you drag logo in to VS code they showing you like math and hard to read. 

- Tony shows how to use SVG styling with HTML and CSS. In css part Tony told us we can do 

```
<style>
Path{
    fill: colors;
    path: colors 
}
</style>
```

addig like this in to color with SVG.

- Use in [SVGOMG] (https://jakearchibald.github.io/svgomg/) and bring to the images and customize the images of logo we made or from others. Therefore, we press moke up and copy the code there and styling it. 


- Fasel helped me how to changed the colors/colors to with code. We spent all time during laptime.
